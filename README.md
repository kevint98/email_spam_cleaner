# Email Spam Cleaner

This a simple Python script that was written to address an issue where my mail client was not successfully filtering spam emails from a particular domain.

## Installation steps

1. Clone/Download this repo
2. Change the IMAP server to match your email provider's
3. Replace email credentials with your own (you may need to acquire an 'app password' from your provider)
4. Change the search pattern accordingly
5. Run the script
